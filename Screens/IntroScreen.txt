This is a game, or maybe a story, about a quest, or an adventure, or a journey, 
yes, an inward journey, or maybe an exploration of euhmm... 
It is about a certain place, that is not real but more of an idea, at a certain time in the euhmm ... 
past, no in the future and the place is an alien planet, so it is a real place! 
But first (in the past?) it was only an idea...
