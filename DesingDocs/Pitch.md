# It's Definately About Balance

The whole idea of the game is that is has a pretty simple but (hopefully) fun mechanic 
of managing 1 basic resource ('life') through another dual/balance resource ('black/white')
with the aid of certain 'items' throughout different interactions.

The reason this sounds vague is because the whole story element is about a storyteller,
who is constantly talking to you but has no idea what the story is about, or if it even 
is a story.

The idea is that the theme in the game is constantly changing, 
which means everthing still works the same 'number-wise', but with different labels.
So one time it can be about fighting generic fantasy monsters in a dungeon, 
and then suddenly the storyteller decides it's about 
debating political oponents on a marketplace during pre election months.

One theme that is always said to be central (just because its associated mechanic is named that way)
is balance, so the running joke throughout the game (implicit of explicit) is that:
