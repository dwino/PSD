# Intro screen
- a scrolling intro screen, with text scrolling back and forth, showing off the storytellers indecisiveness
(doubts can be conveyed trough erasing pieces of text, also scrolling)
- first draft:
    - This is a game, or maybe a story, about a quest, or an adventure, or a journey, yes an inward journey,
    or maybe an exploration off euhmm...
    It's about a certain place, that's not real but more of an idea, at a certain time in the euhmm ... past,
    no in the future and the place is an alien planet, so it is a real place! But first (in the past?) it was 
    only an idea...


- alwasy ending with:
    - and also: 
    It's Definitely About Balance 
    - and then sometimes a joke like:
        - hej, that's the title

# Themes

# Maps
- choice between traditional roguelike map or sanctuary rpg style only (auto interactions)
- roguelike maps are not saved (angband style), some exceptions (base of ops)
- roguelike map is always only one screen, everything visible (no fov) ????????
- Colors (can) change based on theme
